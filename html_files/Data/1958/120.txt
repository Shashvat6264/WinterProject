CITATOR INFO :
E 1966 SC1820 (7,8)
ACT:
Criminal Trial-Counterfeiting trade mark-Limitation, of one year for prosecution-Prosecution, when commences-Whether on filing of complaint or on issue of Process-Indian Merchandise Marks Act, 1889 (4 of 1889), s. 15.

HEADNOTE:
On April 26, 954, the appellant was arrested for offences under ss. 420, 482, 483, 485 and 486 Indian Penal Code and bidis alleged to bear counterfeit trade marks were seized from him. On this a complaint was filed on May 26, against the appellant that he was in possession of counterfeit bidis, wrappers and labels. After investigation, the police submitted a charge sheet on September 30, 1954, and summons was ordered to the appellant on July 22, 1955. The appellant raised a preliminary objection before-the Magistrate that the proceedings were barred by s. 15 of the Indian Merchandise Marks Act. He contended that the offence was discovered on April 26, 1954, when he was arrested and the prosecution which commenced with the issue of process against him on July 22, 1954, was beyond the period of one year provided by s. 15.
Held, that the prosecution was not barred by S. 15 as the prosecution commenced on the presentation of the complaint which was within one year of the discovery of the offence and not on the issuing of the process. It is settled law that unless there is something to the contrary in the statute, when a private complaint is presented it is the date of presentation thereof that marks the commencement of the prosecution. The period of limitation is intended to operate against the complainant and not against the Court.
It will defeat the object of the Act and deprive traders of the protection of the law if it were held that the complaint should be thrown out unless process was issued within one year. of the discovery of the offence.

CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 118 of 1958.
Appeal from the judgment and order dated May 14, 1958, of the Allahabad High Court in Criminal Revision No. 1594 of 1956, arising out of the judgment and order of the Court of Additional Sessions Judge at Kanpur in Criminal Revision No.
13 of 1956.
C. P. Lal, for the appellant.
640 Gopi Nath Dikshit, for the respondent.
1958. November 24. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMA AIYAR, J.-The facts leading up to this appeal are these: On April 26, 1954, the appellant was arrested by the Sisamau Police for offences under ss. 420, 482,483, 485 and 486 of the Indian Penal Code on the allegation that he was in possession of 25 packets of Chand Chhap Biri, which were alleged to bear counterfeit trade marks. On May 26, 1954, one Harish Chandra Jain acting on behalf of Messrs.
Mohan Lal Hargovind Das filed a complaint charging that the appellant was in possession of counterfeit bidis, wrappers and labels and praying that a case under the sections above mentioned be registered and investigated. On that, the Magistrate passed the following order :
" S. O. Sisamau. Please investigate and register a case." After investigation, the police submitted their chargesheet on September 30, 1954, and summons was ordered to the appellant on July 22, 1955. On September 17, 1955, the appellant filed an application before the Magistrate wherein he raised a preliminary objection that the proceedings were barred by s. 15 of the Indian Merchandise Marks Act, 1889 (4 of 1889), hereinafter referred to as the Act. That section provides :
" No such prosecution as is mentioned in the last foregoing section shall be commenced after the expiration of three years next after the commission of the offence, or one year after the first discovery thereof by the prosecutor, whichever expiration first happens." The contention of the appellant was that the offence was discovered on April 26, 1954, when he was arrested and the goods seized, and that, in consequence, the issue of process on July 22, 1955, was beyond the period of one year provided under s. 15 of the Act, and that the proceedings should therefore be quashed as barred by limitation. The Magistrate rejected this contention, and a Revision Petition preferred against this order to the Additional Sessions Judge, Kanpur, 641 shared the same fate. The appellant then filed a further Revision Petition to the High Court of Allahabad, being Criminal Revision No. 1594 of 1956, and the same was heard along with other similar Revision Petitions by a Bench consisting of James and Takru, JJ. By their judgment dated May 13, 1958, the learned Judges held that the prosecution commenced when the complaint was presented on May 26, 1954, and that as the discovery was on April 26, 1954, the proceedings were within time under s. 15 of the Act. In view of the importance of the question raised, they granted leave to appeal to this Court under Art. 134 (1)(c) of the Constitution, and that is how the matter comes before us.
The point for decision is, when does a prosecution commence for purposes of s. 15 of the Act, whether on the date when the complaint is preferred, or when the process is issued thereon? The word "prosecution " is not defined in the Act, nor are there any provisions therein bearing on this question. Now, under the law and apart from statutory prescriptions, a prosecution commences, where it is at the instance of a private prosecutor, when the complaint is preferred. The position is thus stated in Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol. X, 3rd Edn., p. 340, para. 630:
" Criminal prosecutions, except where there are statutory provisions to the contrary, may be commenced at any time after the commission of the offence. A prosecution is commenced, when an information is laid before a justice, or, if there is no information, when the accused is brought before a justice to answer the charge, or, if there is no preliminary examination before a justice, when an indictment is preferred. " It is further stated there that different statutes provide for various periods of limitation within which a prose- cution could be commenced after the commission of the offence, and that three years is the period provided for an offence under the Merchandise Marks, Act, 1887, which corresponds to the Indian Merchandise Marks Act, 1889. It is therefore settled law that unless 642 there is something to the contrary in the statute, when a private complaint is presented it is the date of pre- sentation thereof that marks the commencement of the prosecution.
Now, what is the nature of the prosecution under s. 15 of the Act ? It is relevant in this connection to refer to ss.
13 and 14, which run as follows:
S. 13: ',In the case of goods brought into India' by sea, evidence of the port of shipment shall, in a prosecution for an offence against this Act or section 18 of the Sea Customs Act, 1878, as amended by this Act, be prima facie evidence of the place or country in which the goods were made or produced." S. 14(1): " On any such prosecution as is mentioned in the last foregoing section or on any prosecution for an offence against any of the sections of the Indian Penal Code, as amended by this Act, which relate to trade, property and other marks, the Court may order costs to be paid to the defendant by the prosecutor or to the prosecutor by the defendant, having regard to the information given by and the conduct of the defendant and prosecutor respectively.
(2) Such costs shall, on application to the Court, be recoverable as if they were fine." The object of the above provisions is to protect the rights of persons who manufacture and sell goods with distinct trade marks against invasion by other persons passing off their goods fraudulently and with counterfeit trade marks as those of the manufacturers. Normally, the remedy for such infringement will be by action in Civil Courts. But in view of the delay which is incidental to civil proceedings and the great injustice which might result if the rights of manufacturers are not promptly protected, the law gives them the right to take the matter before the Criminal Courts, and prosecute the offenders, so as to enable them effectively ,and speedily to vindicate their rights. It is for this, reason that a short period of limitation is provided heir preferring a complaint under a. 15 of the and there is also a special provision for award of costs of the proceedings to or by the complainant.
