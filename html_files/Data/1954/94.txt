ACT:
Representation of the People Act (XLIII of 1961), ss. 7(8) and 9--General Clauses Act (X of 1897), s. 3(8)-Government of Part C States Act (XLIX of 1951), s. 17-Government contract with the Part C State Government whether contract with the Central Government--And thus a disqualification for election to Legislative Assembly of State under s. 17 of Act XLIX of 1951 read with s. 7(d) of Act XLIII of 1951.

HEADNOTE:
Held, (modifying the view of law taken in Civil Appeal No. 52 of 1954) that in view of section 3(8) of the General Clauses Act, 1897, a contract with the Chief Commissioner in a Part C State (in this case Himachal Pradesh Chief Commissioner) is a contract with the Central Government and that would be a disqualification for election to the Legislative Assembly of the State under section 17 of Act XLIX of 1951, read with section 7(d) of Act XLIII of 1951.

CIVIL APPEAL JURISDICTION: Civil Miscellaneous Petition No, 641 of 1954, 72 562 Application for review of the Judgment of this Court in Civil Appeal No. 152 of 1954.
N. C. Chatterjee (G. C. Mathur, with him) for the petitioner.
Veda Vyas (S. K. Kapoor and Naunit Lal, with him) for the respondent.
1954. October 18. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMA AYYAR J.-This is an application for review of the judgment of this Court in Civil Appeal No. 52 of 1954.
That was an appeal against an order of the Election Tribunal, Himachal Pradesh (Simla), dismissing a petition to set aside the election of the respondent to the Legislative Assembly, Himachal Pradesh, from the Rohru Constituency.
Two points were raised at the hearing of the appeal before us: One was that the respondent was disqualified for election to the Assembly under section 17 of Act No. XLIX of 1951, read with section 7(d) of Act No. XLIII of 195 1, by reason of the fact that he was interested in contracts for the supply of Ayurvedic Medicines to the Himachal Pradesh Government, and the other, that he had appointed Government servants as polling agents, and had thereby contravened section 123(8) of Act No. XLIII of 1951.
On the first question, we held that, on a true construction of section 17, what would be a disqualification for election to either House of Parliament under article 102 would, under that section, be disqualification for election to the Legislatures of Part C States, and that the disqualification under section 7 (d) of Act No. XLIII of 1951 would accordingly be a disqualification under section 17 of Act No. XLIX of 195 1. A further contention was then raised on behalf of the respondent that even if section 7(d) were to be imported into section 17, that would not disqualify him, because under that section, the disqualification must be to being elected to either House of Parliament, and that under sections 7 and 9 of Act No. XLIII of 1951, a contract to operate as a disqualification to the election to either House of Parliament must be, with the Central Government, whereas 563 the contracts of the respondent were with the Government of Himachal Pradesh. The answer of the petitioner to this contention was that under article 239 the administration of Part C States was vested in the President acting through the Chief Commissioner or the Lieutenant-Governor, and that the contracts of the respondent with the Chief Commissioner, Himachal Pradesh, must be held to be contracts with the Central Government. We, however, disagreed with this con- tention, and held that article 239 had not the effect of merging States with the Central Government, and converting contracts with the States into those with the Central Government.
In this application, Mr. Chatterjee appearing for the petitioner invites our attention to the definition of " Central Government " in section 3(8)(b)(ii) of the General Clauses Act. It is as follows:
"Central Governmnet" shall in relation to anything done or to be done after the commencement of the Constitution, mean the President; and shall include in relation to the administration of a Part C State, the Chief Commissioner or Lieutenant-Governor or Government of a neighbouring State or other authority acting within the scope of the authority given to him or it under article 239 or article 243 of the Constitution, as the case may be." He argues that by force of this definition, contracts with the Chief Commissioner of Himachal Pradesh must be treated as contracts with the Central Government, and that in consequence, the respondent was disqualified for election under section 17 of Act No. XLIX of 1951, read along with section 7(d) of Act No. XLIII of 1951.
As against this, Mr. Veda Vyas for the respondent relies on the definition of " State " in section 3(60)(b) of the General Clauses Act, which runs as follows:
" State Government " as respects anything done or to be done after the commencement of the Constitution, shall mean, in a Part A State, the Governor, in a Part B State the Rajpramukh, and in a Part C State the Central Government." 564 His contention is that there being in the Constitution a fundamental distinction between the Government of the Union and Government of the States, section 3(8) of the General Clauses Act should be so construed as not to destroy that distinction, and that having regard to the definition of " State " in section 3(60), it must be held that to the extent the Central Government administers Part C States under article 239, its character is that of the State Governments.
We are unable to agree that section 3(8) has the effect of putting an end to the status of Part C -States as independent units, distinct from the Union Government under the Constitution. It merely recognies that those States are centrally administered through the President under article 239, and enacts that the expression " Central Government " should include the Chief Commissioner administering a Part C State under the authority given to him under article 239.
Section 3(8) does not affect the status of Part C States as distinct entities having their own Legislature and judiciary, as provided in articles 239 and 240. Its true scope will be clear if, adapting it, we substitute for the words " Central Government" in section 9 of Act No. XLIII of 195 1, the words " the Chief commissioner acting within the scope of the authority given to him under article 239." A contract with the Chief Commissioner would, therefore, under section 9 read with section 3(8) of the General Clauses Act, be a contract with the Central Government, and would operate as a disqualification for election to either House of Parliament under sections 7(d) and 9 of Act No. XLIII of 1951, 'and it would be a disqualification under section 17 of Act No. XLIX of 1951, for election to the Legislative Assembly of the State.
It is argued for the respondent that this construction would lead to this anomaly that whereas in the States in Part A or Part B a contract with the State would operate as disqualification only for election to the State Legislatures, such a contract would in Part C States operate as a disqualification to be chosen, both to the State Legislature and to either House of Parliament. That anomaly is undoubtedly 565 there. But the contrary conclusion also involves the anomaly already pointed out, that in Part C States a contract with the State Government is not a disqualification for election even to the State Legislature, as it is in Parts A and B States. Whatever the anomaly, in our view, the proper course is to give effect to the plain language of the statute. We must accordingly hold that in view of section 3(8) of the General Clauses Act, a contract with the Chief Commissioner in a Part C State is a contract with the Central Government, and that would be a disqualification for election to the Legislative Assembly under section 17 of Act No. XLIX of 1951 read with section 7(8) of Act No. XLIII of 1951.
